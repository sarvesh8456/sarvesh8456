  #what selection adjustment method to use
  # ACCUMULATE - accumulate all bad sectors up to the initial selection (even distribution, slow at large radii)
  # NEAREST - try nearest non-hit (possible clustering, but fast)
  # REROLL - reroll early on a known hit (even distribution, non-deterministic time, but still fast)
  # NONE - don't check if it's a known hit, just load and try (best for massive radii, >50k)
